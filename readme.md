# *BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION*


* Bitcoin is very popolar nowadays.Due to its popularity and it's high returns one still need to look after its market trend because its prices vary  .In this project we  will explore bitcoin data ,look at the bitcoin prices trends and perform time series analysis  using RNN and LSTM to predict bitcoin prices for next 30 days.<br>
Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data),there are many missing data in the dataset , i have extracted those missing data using selenium in extract_data.ipynb.
* bitcoin_price_predict.ipynb has the bitcoin analysis and price prediction.
* model folder contains the trained RNN and LSTM price prediction models.
* bitcoinunix.csv has the scraped missing data using selenium.
